<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="PhotoOfMe.jpeg" alt="Photo of me" width="150">
<p>
    My name is Faith Grenon, and I am currently pursuing <strong>Computer Engineering
    Technology - Computing Science</strong> at Algonquin College. In my program, I have
    gained experience in <em><mark>Java Programming</mark>, Database Systems, Linux Operating Systems,
    and Networking</em>, which has allowed me to build a strong foundation in the technical
    field. So far in this program, it has been filled with projects that challenged me to 
    think deep to solve the problems given, and to help push out of my comfort zone.
</p>
<p>
    What makes me unique is my ability to <strong>learn quick</strong>. I adapt to new technologies,
    softwares, and tools easily which allows me to stay ahead in the fast growth of computing science.
    I really like to do challenges that make me learn a new programming language or troubleshooting
    unfamiliar systems. This will make me grow further into this career. I also do well at <strong>
    working well under stress</strong>. Deadlines, complex projects, or working with lots of pressure
    keeps me motivated to stay focused and deliver the best results. I see this as an opportunity to
    <em>demonstrate my skills and prove my work ethic</em>.
